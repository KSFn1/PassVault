# 1) Project Overview

1.1 Problem Statement\
\_What problem are you solving and for whom? (3--5 sentences)\_

We are trying to help people who are constantly online and use many
accounts to be able to keep track of their usernames and passwords
reliably. We want to ensure that the information is stored securely with
advanced encryption methods. Lastly, we want our users to be able to
access their stored information safely and fast, therefore, we will
require users to login before being able to access their stored
information and once logged in, there will be a search bar where they
can easily search for what they're looking for.

1.2 Users & Context\
- Primary users: Anyone with digital presence of any age\
- User needs: Being able to access data securely, saving data securely,
and being able to search for information easily.\
- Context & constraints: Hard to manage different accounts on multiple
devices, which makes passwords harder to remember.

1.3 Value Proposition\
Our project provides a secure and efficient way for users to manage
their digital credentials across multiple platforms. Unline traditional
password storage methods that can be easily compromised or disorganized,
our solution uses advanced encryption methods to ensure that user data
remains private and protected. With a simple, user-friendly interface,
individuals can quickly log in and access their stored information
through an integrated search feature, eliminating the frustration of
forgotten passwords. By combining security, spoeed, and accessibility,
our system gives users the power to take control of their digital
presence with confidence and peace of mind.

1.4 Goals & Nonâ€‘Goals

> **Going to implement:**

-   Develop a secure password management system, designed for Windows,
    that allows users to store and retrieve their login credentials
    safely.

-   Implement user authentication to make sure only authorized users can
    access stored data.

-   Integrate advanced encryption techniques to protect sensitive
    information

-   Provide an efficient search feature to quickly find saved usernames
    and passwords.

-   Design a simple, intuitive user interface for easy navigation and
    usability.

**Not going to implement:**

-   Implementing password sharing or team based account management
    feature

-   Integrating biometric authentication like fingerprint and face ID

-   Building browser extensions or mobile app versions

-   Implementing multi device synchronization or cloud backup generation

-   Automatically saving new information or giving users a pop up option
    of their username and password when logging into a platform

# 2) Requirements

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2 Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)\
Trace to user stories.

1\) Given when I am logged into Passvault, enter my credentials on the
stored passwords page and click save, then the app will store the
correct credentials

2\) Given when I am logged into Passvault and click "generate password"
on the password generation page, then it will return a password with
unique letters, numbers and symbols.

3\) Given when I enter the correct credentials on Passvault login page,
then the app will automatically direct me to the other pages.

4\) Given when I want to navigate through Passvault, then the pages
should have clear information and labels

5)Given when Passvault's local data files are accessed by an
unauthorised third party, then the stored information will appear as
ciphertext and therefore, unreadable.

6\) Given when a developer wants to update a certain part of the app and
views the code, then he should be able to see clear labels in the chunks
of code.

2.3 Assumptions & Constraints\
Tech limits, time, skills, devices, data, privacy.

Tech limits: no cloud features

Devices: PC only

Time: 3--4-month development window

Skills: Each team member has their own expertise to put everything
together: developing, testing, UI design, etc.

Data/privacy: Since the app is local, unauthorized individuals without
direct access to your computer will not be able to access your
passwords.

5.2 Style Guide\
- Colors (hex + roles)

-   670A7E for header and positive action buttons (login, register,
    submit)

-   20A6C4 for negative action buttons (cancel)

-   000000 for texts and footer

-   FFFFFF for background color, header titles (page name, nav titles),
    and footer texts

-   FF0000 for submit button on the contact us page, the delete button
    on the dashboard, and the logout button.

-   1A6D13 for the "Add" and modify button on the dashboard.

-   EEEEEE/D9D9D9 for text background fields

\- Typography (headings/body)

-   All texts are in the "Inter" font or similar, depending on what the
    IDE supports

-   Headings are bolded and in upper case, 40px

-   Subheadings are not bolded and written normally, 20px

-   Normal texts are written normally, 11px

\- Iconography

We will not use icons in our solution

\- Components & states (default/hover/focus/disabled/error)

-   The default buttons are as outlined above in terms of color.

-   Any button that is hovered over will turn 2 shades darker

-   Disabled buttons will have their texts turned white and are not
    hover able

-   Our product does not require error or focus buttons.

# 6) Interaction Design

**States & behaviors: loading, empty, success, error.**

> Loading:

-   When saving or retrieving passwords, a spinner or progress indicator
    is shown.

> Empty:

-   If the user hasn't stored any passwords yet, an empty state will be
    shown displaying text that reads "No passwords saved yet" or
    something along those lines. It will also display a button which you
    can use to add one.

Success:

-   After adding, editing, or deleting a password, a text will be shown
    that confirms that action.

> Error:

-   If a save fails or the user inputs something invalid, an error
    message will be displayed, with helpful information about the error.
    i.e. if the user inputs something invalid, they will be told to
    enter the right input.

**Keyboard interactions and focus management.**

-   Tab navigation is supported across all fields and buttons.

-   When a page is opened, the first place that has input gets focus.

-   After an action is performed (like saving), focus returns somewhere
    logical.

**Microcopy: errors, empty states, tooltips, button labels.**

Errors:

-   Will be short and direct. I.e. "Passwords cannot be empty".

Empty States:

-   Will be short and direct. I.e. "Passwords cannot be empty".\
    \
    Tooltips:

-   Used for icons or important actions. E.g., hovering over the delete
    icon will display\
    "Delete this password".\
    \
    Button Labels:

-   Clear action verbs like Add, Save, Edit, Delete, Cancel.

# 7) System Overview (Lightweight)

Architecture, services/APIs, simple diagram.\
Table of external services if any.

-   We will use Google API to send emails

Architecture/components:

1)  Login page

2)  Password recovery tool

3)  Password list with modifier settings

4)  Password generator

5)  Encryption tool

# 8) GitHub Workflow (Course Conventions)

Repository URL, default branch, branching strategy, issues/milestones,
PR checklist.

**Repository URL:**

<https://github.com/JS-457/JAKS-CSSD-1661-Project.git>

**Default Branch:**

Master

**Branching Strategy:**

Master: always clean and stable

Test: where new features are tested and combined

Feature branches: one branch for each feature

**Issues & Milestones:**

Issues help track bugs, improvements, and future tasks.

Milestones merge issues into goals for a project (v1.0)

Example issues and milestones created on GitHub.

**PR Checklist (Pull Requests)**

\[ \] Code runs locally with no errors

\[ \] Comments and variable names are clear

\[ \] README and documentation updated

\[ \] No console errors or print statements

\[ \] Code has been reviewed by a reviewer

# 9) Testing Plan

Usability checks with 3 participants (short task script, success
criteria).\
Functional checks (happy/edge paths) with traceability to stories.

Task 1: Create Passvault credentials for the login page.

Success Criteria: be able to login within 90 seconds successfully

Task 2: enter 3 different email/password combinations and manage to
store them under a given name.

Success Criteria: The app registers these credentials and when logged
out and back in, the passwords are still stored inside.

Task 3: Ask the app to generate a password about 15 times and compare
each generated password for uniqueness

Success Criteria: all generated passwords are unique

# 10) Accessibility & Inclusion

Keyboard-only navigation, alt text, labels, error recovery help,
inclusive language.

We will have clear labels with simple dictionary and added descriptions
